  `c2898d38b8cf0c53b43c021a64c4175cbec33b8f`.
- Re-read live HEAD before writes; preserve history and use expected-SHA updates.

## CI activation: working external runner, not an unverified local substitute

The Lean fork did not record PS0 branch workflows. Its activation cause is
still unestablished. An isolated CI-only branch in the existing Actions-enabled
`dwijayuda/pskernel` repository now checks out **immutable Lean-fork commits**:

- Runner branch: `ci/ps0-proof-linked-runner-20261029`; draft PR #210.
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/ps0-external-proof-linked.yml`.
- Source selector: `ci/ps0-source.json`; no moving source branch is trusted.
- No PSC0/PSC1 source is changed. No main merge or package publication.
- Host tests run on Ubuntu 24.04; proof replay runs on Ubuntu 22.04.
  The 24.04 runner rejected Bubblewrap loopback setup before proof execution;
  22.04 supports the original isolation. No sandbox-disable flag or global
  security relaxation was introduced.
- Runner commit, source commit and CI run identity must always be distinguished.

## Executed evidence, not inferred milestones

Run https://github.com/dwijayuda/pskernel/actions/runs/40770867836 tested source
`e1fed198e43ef84ddf6fa740b8acac257c7ce68e` using runner commit
`b766064ca662b575575af5edc127396f0aaa36b3`.

Observed and inspected:

- Full PS0 executable, existing libraries and Verified model/emitter/extractor:
  **31 build jobs completed successfully** with the exact Lean pin.
- Host contract suite: **27/27 passed**.
- Resource-bound Lean regressions: passed; the deep saturation property uses
  induction rather than increasing elaboration limits or trusting native_decide.
- Bubblewrap isolation probe: passed, without disabling network namespaces.
- Actual inventory `.ps` checking through `lake exe ps0 check`: passed.
- Official `lake comparator --config source-comparator.json` began sandboxed
  builds, then correctly failed a public-name visibility error in the generated
  challenge. Neither proof comparator nor runtime qualification is yet claimed
  successful at this checkpoint.

Evidence artifact: `12853080469`, ZIP SHA-256
`d2617f0ee57b7e859f268eaeada3d7827afd6932aa1dc1359a8f40c186c6454e`.
The earlier `proof-linked-status-20261029.json` records the initial unexecuted
state only; it is not the current execution status.

## Repairs already made from actual logs

Committed the missing dependency-free Lake manifest; corrected the pinned
trailing-separator parser descriptor, MacroM diagnostics, JSON names, explicit
native quotation categories, compound syntax atoms, numeric counter inference,
native implementation signatures and a reserved local identifier. Converted
the source-support dependency chain to modern modules with actual meta staging;
kept semantic model/effect definitions ordinary and exposed where their proof
interfaces require definitional access.

The original compiler implementation therefore HAS changed in this continuation;
older documents saying all compiler sources are unchanged describe the earlier
candidate commit, not this checkpoint. No normative R2 revision is made.

The host now bounds file reads and potentially exponential target expansion,
binds all source/challenge/configuration inputs across both proof phases,
revalidates after target execution, records host/tool identities, and refuses
wrong target versions. The emitter checks its size budget before expanding the
candidate AST/text. Nine additional host regressions cover these boundaries.

The current checkpoint fixes the observed visibility failure with separate
`public import` and `import all` declarations in generated and authored proof
modules. It does not use forbidden `public import all` or bypass the comparator.
Run 40771430923 is the next qualification attempt for source `811487db...`;
inspect its completed logs before recording further PASS claims.

## Scope and next gate

Continue until the bounded `.ps` → full-Lean proof → exact Nat2 IR → JS/TS
pipeline and intended refusal tests execute successfully. Then retain the exact
conditional artifact and receipts, and add focused regression evidence for the
frontend/module repairs. Do not mark the entire MB0–MB3 roadmap or R2 complete
from a single example.

The only publication profile remains `conditional-nat2-reviewed-v0`;
`verified-portable` is refused. Source/extraction/target-model proofs do not
prove the complete JS engine, TypeScript compiler, serializer, arbitrary
compile-time-code isolation or foreign libraries. Full language closure,
modules, richer types, effects and Python/PHP/Rust backends remain separate.

All actual validation in this continuation is Linux GitHub Actions. No local
compiler build, force push, main merge, registry publication or new proof kernel.
